Gavriel, did I say that you can open the window?
No, you’re not allowed to open the window when Mommy’s driving.
That’s very dangerous.
If you want the window to be opened, you can ask Mommy to open it.
Please can I open this
Uh, yes you may.
You can open it a little bit.
And thank you for asking nicely and saying please.
Yes, that’s it.
Good boy.
I did it a little bit.
Yes, that’s a little bit.
That’s right.
But this is mine to touch to this.
Right, it’s don’t touch the button anymore ok?
ok
The car in front
Mommy...Truck goes up or down
Right it goes
If someone knocks it they are going up and down
That’s right
This is down, this is up.
Right! 
Correct!
Gavriel, is Ezra sleeping?
Yep
Aw, he fell asleep?
What a silly little baby
He likes to sleep when we are in the car, right?
Also when we are at home
Also when we are at home
Well, sometimes.
But last night he decided he did not want to sleep at all, right?
He was up all night and mommy was up all night
What a silly little baby!
