Do You Know why?
I don’t know
You don't know?
Well because when they want to built a road but there is something blocking..…
One more!!!
One more tunnel!
When we are building a road and there is a mountain in the way
We can't see here. I’m not gonna see. I’m not gonna see. I’m not gonna see.
You can’t see.
We are in the tunnel we are in the tunnel in the tunnel
No!
Hooray, now we are out!
do you want to hear now about why we have tunnels?
Um no
no?
I'm going to tell you very quickly
when  they are building a road and we get to a point where we can't go straight anymore bc there is a mountain, or sea or a river actually, probably not a sea. 
When there is a river or mt in the way, sometimes it will take too long or too many resources if we build around.
Maybe if we can build around or over the river or mt, so we make holes in the mt and put a tunnel inside. 
Wow
so we can go through the mt. or through the river. 
Otr through the tunnel
Right, then we go through the tunnel; once we have a tunnel we can go through it. 
But before there is  a tunnel there is just a mt. and they make a big big hole through the tunnel
Careful.
These!
Ahhhhh these these
Ahh what are those?
Excavators
excavator
An excavator
And what is this?
wocks
Rocks? 
You see lots and lots of rocks
yea
It is called the graveller machine.
It turns big rocks into little rocks.
That’s called a bulldozer
Bulldozer!
And another excavator there
Wow look at all of these big trucks
Look it used to be all mountain here and they cleared the mt away to make the road bigger
I bet all these trucks are in the truck book that we read. 
Do you remember them?
When we say beep beep with all this stuff, we say beep beep
What?
What gavrieli?
Nothing
