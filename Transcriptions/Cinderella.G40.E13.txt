Cinderella's stepmother said : Cinderella may go but only if she finishes her

Breaking is when you're doing it right now and we say Gavriel you are breaking that.

At the ball the prince danced with Cinderella all evening
She felt as if she were floating on
a dream
A dream
The King and the grand duke were delighted to see them falling
In love
In love
But as the clock struck midnight cinderella ran from the palace. 
She was in such a hurry that she left one glass slipper behind . 
The prince ran after her but 
It was too late
it was too late
The next day the prince sent the grand duke door to door to find the young woman who had lost her 
slipper glass
Her slipper glass
When she got when they got to Cinderellas house both sister’s tried on the glass slipper
But they were too but their feet were too big
Right there feet were much too big
Cinderella's stepmother told the grand duke that there was no other ladies in the house
Was that right?
Yea
Were there no there ladies in the house?
Ytea
No there… are you sure?
There wasn't anyone left?
No
What about Cinderella?
Yea
Yea
So she told them that there was no there were no other ladies but there were right?
There was one other lady
What happened?
The lady locked cinderella does in behind
Yeah well she locked cinderella in her room upstairs on purpose.
But cinderella's little friends gus and Jacque stole the key from her stepmother's pocket and opened her door and freed Cinderella
Just in time
Just in time
When Cinderella appeared and asked if she could try on the slipper, her stepmother was
Furous
Furious thats right
She tripped the footman who was holding the slipper on a pillow.
Pillow
It fell to the floor and
Shattered
Shattered
What does it mean to shatter?
To fall down 
No it fell on the floor and it shattered
What’s shattered?
I don’t know
When it breaks into lots of little tiny pieces
You get you get boo boos
Yea
You get a boo boo if there is shattered glass on the floor.
It’s terrible.
But Cinderella reached into her apron pocket and pulled out the matching one. It was a perfect
Fit
Hey that’s not the right story wait one second
The grand duke was happy and relieved that he had found the slipper’s owner. 
The prince would be married at last and cinderella's dreams would all 
Now i want to come true

The end

They should have been nice sisters, but they were mean sisters.
They didn’t love her.
Why? They didn't want her to be happy they wanted her to be sad
They said sorry?
No they didn't say sorry
Why?
Because they aren’t nice girls.
They are going to be punished.
You know what their punishment is?

Well I think that if they were nice to cinderella and cinderella married the prince they would have been able to move into the castle also
What do you think?
I think that ya
But now because they were mean, now they are not gonna move into the castle with cinderella
Why
And they would have been happier i think
Why they not
Because they aren't nice to cinderella why would Cinderella be why would Cinderella be nice to them and let them come to the castle? 
She is probably happy to never talk to them again
De cat made the floor dirty
Yea
That was mean also, right?
Uh huh
Not nice
She worked so hard to clean the floor and then the cat made the floor dirty?
Yea
Oy vey
Why after she cleaned the tables she cleaned the floor.

I don't know if he made the table dirty or not but i know that he was spending all his time making all the floors dirty and she caught him in the middle
What in the middle
In the middle of him making the floors dirty
While he was  prancing around the floors with the dust on his paws getting paw prints all over the floors she saw and she yelled at him and then the doorbell rang right? 
Who was at the door?
