Let's take out your pacifier until you are done eating.

Gavriel can you say silly?
Silly

Good
No no no please don't pick your nose
It’s very bad especially ‘cause you are sick so you have germs
And If you pick your nose and eat it, it is really uchy
You are eating your germs and then you will put your germs on other things that you touch
I didn't feel any mucus
Then why were you sticking your finger in your nose?
Ray!
Way way
What are you doing with the pasta, Ezzy?
Way 
Pasta
Hooway no more!
Hooray no more, but there is more. 
You just put it behind your tray
Instead of in your bowl.
How many pieces of pasta do you have left?
Can you count them?
Five five five hooray
Five five five hooray?
No it’s 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

I am very proud of you.
Gavriel you learn so fast
Whenever i teach you something, you learn it right away.
It makes me so proud of you.
You are so smart.
You're putting the pasta back in the bowl?
Are you going to eat it or are you just going to play with it Ezra?
Mo-ee

Ezra isnt finished.
You finished yours still
Hm?

Look at that mouth!
After I put it in your mouth you have to close your mouth, ok?
You are so cute!
Ooo I love you
Ahhhh

With the other Finger behind your thumb
And then you push the other finger forward, pushing your thumb away.
Oooo
And it goes bop!
sneeze
Oo! 
Sneeze 
Bless you!

Bless you!
Mommy right it says boo

Boo
There are some games you can play with bottle caps where you flick the bottle cap to the other person and you see if you can get it into the goal.
It’s like table soccer 
Right 
One of the ballies there is a ball and one of the same
Yeah maybe you can play with the marbles or something
And he has a stick to get it into the goal
Right!
Hockey?
Ya
